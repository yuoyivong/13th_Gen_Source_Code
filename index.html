          <b>Koh Rong</b> is the biggest of the islands off the coast of
          Sihanoukville in the Gulf of Thailand. It stretches from south-east to
          north-west, is roughly elongate shaped and it encompasses an area of
          <mark
            ><u><i>78 km2 (30 sq mi)</i></u></mark
          >. The terrain is predominantly hilly with a sizable mountain
          <mark
            ><u><i>316 m (1,037 ft)</i></u></mark
          >
          at the island's north-west. The hills provide water for countless
          creeks and estuaries. The island's interior is almost completely
          forested, concealing a number of seasonal waterfalls.
          <b>Koh Rong</b> has around
          <mark
            ><u><i>43 km (27 mi)</i></u></mark
          >
          of delicate beaches. There are no less than 23 beaches of varying
          length and coloration—from (predominantly) white to beige to
          rose-colored sands—along most of the coastline. Bays, protruding capes
          and impressive sandstone rock formations contribute to the island's
          scenic panorama. The southern coastline, exposed to the weather and
          open sea, is particularly spectacular, whereas the eastern coast,
          which faces towards the land, is characterized by a sequence of smooth
          hills, gently sloping towards the numerous crescent-shaped beaches,
          inlets and bays. Several small islets and many reefs provide an
          abundance of natural environments for a great variety of marine life.
          The center of the island is a flat "belt" of sediments that joins the
          two hilly massifs of the south-east and north-west. Here is a small
          savanna—the result of human activities and cultivation.

        <p>
          What's great about <b>Long Set (4K) Beach</b>, apart from the stunning
          scenery and inviting pristine waters, is that it's a short walk away
          from the main tourist area on Koh Rong (Koh Touch). If you head past
          Paradise Bungalows and White Beach Bungalows on your left hand side,
          the next resort is Tree House. Keep walking following the beach area
          around, and you will pass a new resort called Star Fish. At times you
          will need to go off the actual beach itself into the forest, but the
          path is very easy to follow. After about <mark>15 minutes</mark> you
          will walk out onto a large beach expanse (about 4km or so - hence the
          name '4K') with very little development (though new resorts are
          currently being built).

        </h3>

        <p>
          Sok San Beach (ឆ្នេរសុខសាន), also known as Long Beach, is a 7km long
          sandy white beach located on the western coast of Koh Rong Island.
          People may have seen this beach before as it has featured on the
          Survivor series and the Sok San Resort was actually constructed for
          the purpose of housing staff and crew related to the production. Sok
          San Resort is one of the many accommodation options along the beach.
          More about accommodation options further below. The 7km long beach
          features Sok San Port (ផែសុខសាន្ត) at its northern end which is
          surrounded by a few shops and restaurants after which it is basically
          7km of unbroken sand white beach. The beachfront is nicest around Sok
          San Resort, Royal Sands, and Long Beach Resort as they actively keep
          their private frontage clean and neat. Other sections of the beach can
          collect odd rubbish that is either left or washes ashore.

        <p>
          Things to do along Soksan beach are mostly centered on simply enjoying
          what is (currently) a not overly developed, beautiful beach, with aqua
          azure waters. Long beach walks are a must taking in the different
          scenery and even stopping by the bars at the other bungalows/resorts
          for refresher along the way. Sunsets are spectacular. Other activities
          include swimming, pier fishing, snorkeling, kayaking or renting a bike
          and exploring the island trails through the native jungle. Also not to
          be missed is the bioluminescent plankton seen along the ocean’s edge
          at night. If you are on an extended stay, you can also join in on
          island hopping tours which your resort can organize for you. Scuba
          diving tours are another option. If you are not already staying there,
          you can also walk along the beach to one of the upscale resorts and
          splurge on yourself by enjoying spa services, massage, gym, pool, bar,
          and their restaurants.
